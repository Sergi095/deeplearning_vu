    "#### Instructions on how to use this notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is hosted on Google Colab. To be able to work on it, you have to create your own copy. Go to *File* and select *Save a copy in Drive*.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also avoid using Colab entirely, and download the notebook to run it on your own machine. If you choose this, go to *File* and select *Download .ipynb*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantage of using Colab is that you can use a GPU. You can complete this tutorial with a CPU, but it will take a bit longer. Furthermore, we encourage you to train using the GPU not only for faster training, but also to get experience with this setting. This includes moving models and tensors to the GPU and back. This experience is very valuable because for many interesting models and large datasets (like large CNNs for ImageNet, or Transformer models trained on Wikipedia), training on GPU is the only feasible way.\n",
    "\n",
    "The default Colab runtime does not have a GPU. To change this, go to *Runtime - Change runtime type*, and select *GPU* as the hardware accelerator. The GPU that you get changes according to what resources are available at the time, and its memory can go from a 5GB, to around 18GB if you are lucky. If you are curious, you can run the following in a code cell to check:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "!nvidia-smi\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that despite the name, Google Colab does  not support collaborative work without issues. When two or more people edit the notebook concurrently, only one version will be saved. You can choose to do group programming with one person sharing the screen with the others, or make multiple copies of the notebook to work concurrently.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Submission:** Upload your notebook in .ipynb format to Canvas. The code and answers to the questions in the notebook are sufficient, no separate report is expected."

    "\n",
    "Graphs are very useful data structures that allow us to represent sets of entities and the way they are related among each other. In a graph, entities are also known as *nodes*, and any link between entities is also called an *edge*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of real world objects that can be modeled as graphs are social networks, where entities are people and relations denote friendship; and molecules, where entities are atoms and relations indicate a bond between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "There has been increased interest in the recent years in the application of deep learning architectures to graph-structured data, for tasks like predicting missing relations between entities, classifying entities, and classifying graphs. This interest has been spurred by the introduction of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you will implement and experiment with one of the first versions of the GCN, proposed by Thomas Kipf and Max Welling in their 2017 paper, [Semi-supervised Classification with Graph Convolutional Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.02907).

In the case of a molecule, the node could represent an atom and have features like the atomic mass, etc. We can lay out the features in a matrix $X\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n\\times c}$, so that the feature vector for node $i$ is in the $i$-th row."

    "[Proteins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_(nutrient)) are parts of the buildings block of life. They consist of chains of amino acids, and can take many shapes. In the PROTEINS dataset, proteins are represented as graphs, where the nodes are amino acids, and an edge between them indicates that they are 6 [Angstroms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angstrom) apart. All graphs have a binary label, where 1 means that the protein is not an enzyme.\n",

It also comes with custom code that takes care of aspects that you dealt with manually in this notebook, like a more efficient implementation of the adjacency matrix multiplication via message-passing methods, and Data Loaders that relieve you from having to build block diagonal sparse matrices.\n",
